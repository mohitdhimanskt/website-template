  **Backpacking** is a form of low-cost, independent travel, often staying in
  inexpensive lodgings and carrying all necessary possessions in a
  [backpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack "Backpack"). Once seen as a
  marginal form of travel undertaken only through necessity, it has since become
  a mainstream form of
  tourism.\[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_(travel)#cite_note-1)


  While backpacker tourism is generally a form of [youth travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_travel "Youth travel"), primarily undertaken by young people during [gap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year "Gap year"), it is also undertaken by older people during a career break or retirement. Backpackers tend to be from [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), the [English-speaking world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world "English-speaking world") and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia").\[[2]]
