  **Hamta Pass** lies at an altitude of 4270 m (14039 ft) on the [Pir Panjal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_Panjal "Pir Panjal") range in the [Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas "Himalayas"). It is a small corridor between [Lahaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaul "Lahaul")'s Chandra Valley and the [Kullu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullu "Kullu") valley of [Himachal Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh "Himachal Pradesh"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"). The nomenclature of the trek was derived from Hamta Village, located below Sethan village, as part of the trek route. This pass is frequently used by shepherds of the lower Himalayan region, seeking high altitude grasslands in the summer, when the dry cold desert of Lahaul is barren.
