*The imposing Himalayas inspired Rudyard Kipling to exclaim, ‘Surely the gods live here; this is no place for men’. Himachal Pradesh is legendary for the diversity of landscapes it traverses. There are forests, glacial lakes, snow-capped peaks, plains and stretches of ice formed from snow. Himachali villages dot the cliffs and are an extraordinary highlight of your trekking journey. **Trekking in Himachal Pradesh** is accessible from March to September. The trekking cost in Himachal Pradesh is not very high. Those who want more can take numerous sidewalks leading to waterfalls, valleys and still more summits.*
