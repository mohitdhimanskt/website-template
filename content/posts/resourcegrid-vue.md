Canyoning at Vashishth is best done during the months of June to August, since rains wonâ€™t dull the experience anyway. The winters are more apt for snow sports, but the monsoons are perfect for canyoning, with the water temperature being just right to cool you down but not freeze you. When in Manali, make sure that you experience canyoning at least once, to take back home adrenaline-spiking memories to last a life time.
